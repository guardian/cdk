The [AWS Cloud Development Kit](aws-cdk) (AWS CDK) is an open-source software
development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it
through AWS CloudFormation.

`@guardian/cdk` builds on CDK to provide Guardian-specific patterns and
constructs. It is an opinionated and secure-by-default way to describe and
provision your AWS resources.

## Quickstart

`@guardian/cdk` expects certain Parameter Store values to be present - for
example, VPC IDs, and the location of dist buckets. To check for account
readiness and fix any issues, run:

    npx @guardian/cdk@latest account-readiness --profile [profile]

Then, instantiate a new CDK app:

    npx @guardian/cdk@latest new --app [app] --stack [stack] --stage [stage]

For example, for the app `riff-raff` we'd do:

```bash
npx @guardian/cdk@latest new \
  --app riff-raff \
  --stack deploy \
  --stage CODE \
  --stage PROD
```

> Tip: Migrating an app? See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-guide.md) for more detail.

> Tip: New to CDK? The [AWS CDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) is worth a read.

### Patterns and Constructs

Once you have your new app, you can start adding patterns and constructs.

Patterns can be imported from the top level of the library:

```typescript
import { GuScheduledLambda } from "@guardian/cdk";
```

We encourage you to use patterns rather than constructs whenever possible.

If you need to use a construct directly, they must be imported from their construct directory:

```typescript
import { GuAutoScalingGroup } from "@guardian/cdk/lib/constructs/autoscaling";
```

Our hope is that patterns solve the majority of your use-cases. If they don't,
please let us know about your use-case so that we can consider supporting it via
a pattern.

Alternatively, PRs are always welcome!
