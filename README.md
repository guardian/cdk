The [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) (AWS CDK) is an open-source software
development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it
through AWS CloudFormation.

`@guardian/cdk` builds on CDK to provide Guardian-specific [patterns](./src/patterns) and
[constructs](./src/constructs). It is an opinionated and secure-by-default way to describe and
provision your AWS resources.

## Quickstart

`@guardian/cdk` expects certain Parameter Store values to be present - for
example, VPC IDs, and the location of dist buckets. To check for account
readiness and fix any issues, run:

    npx @guardian/cdk@latest account-readiness --profile [profile]

Once you've confirmed that your account is ready, you can start provisioning your infrastructure.
