# Migration Guide

This guide describes how to migrate an existing Cloudformation stack (and template) to `@guardian/cdk`.

If you are starting from scratch, see the [new project guide](setting-up-a-gucdk-project.md).

---

## Account readiness

`@guardian/cdk` patterns and constructs rely on parameter store values for things like VPC identifiers and dist buckets.

To ensure AWS your account is set up correctly, run:

    npx @guardian/cdk@latest account-readiness --profile [profile]

Then follow the instructions for any errors.

## Process
Generally speaking, we've found this to be a good process to follow when migrating a stack to GuCDK (assumes use of `npm`):

### Introduce CDK to the repository with CI/CD
1. Create a new project specifying the `--yaml-template-location` flag.

   ```shell
   npx @guardian/cdk@latest new --app [app] --stack [stack] --stage [stage] --package-manager [npm|yarn] --yaml-template-location
   ```

   For example for the app trigr we do
   ```shell
   npx @guardian/cdk@latest new --app trigr --stack ophan --stage PROD  --package-manager npm --yaml-template-location cloudformation/trigr.cfn.yaml
   ```

   See the [new project](setting-up-a-gucdk-project.md) guide for further reading

2. Check to see what changes will be made to the stack:

   ```shell
   npm run diff -- --profile <AWS PROFILE NAME> <STACK ID FROM bin/cdk.ts>
   ```

   Or you could check against local:

   ```shell
   npm run diff -- --template cloudformation/<app>.cfn.yaml <STACK ID FROM bin/cdk.ts>
   ```

   Again taking `trigr` as an example we could do:
   ```shell
   npm run diff -- --template cloudformation/trigr.cfn.yaml Trigr-PROD
   ```
   Use `Trig-PROD` as found in `cdk.ts`:  
   
   `(new Trigr(app, "Trigr-PROD", { stack: "ophan", stage: "PROD" });)`


   This should only show differences in how resources are tagged; GuCDK will add various tags to _all_ resources in the stack.
   If you find this initial diff too noisy, you could temporarily exclude these tags by amending your [stack's props](https://guardian.github.io/cdk/interfaces/constructs_core.GuStackProps.html#withoutTags),
   specifically set `withoutTags` to `true`.

4. Configure CI and CD. See [Setting up a GuCDK project](setting-up-a-gucdk-project.md) for more detail.

5. Raise a PR and merge.

### Migration to CDK
We now have something like this:

```
CDK(cfn.yaml) -> cfn.json
```

That is, CDK is merely wrapping an existing template.

The end goal is for CDK to do all the work, and remove the YAML template:

```
CDK -> cfn.json
```

In the previous phase, we also created a [snapshot test](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/testing.html#testing_snapshot) (`cdk/lib/*.test.ts`),
which we can treat as the source of truth, representing the exact resources in the stack. We can now begin the migration process.

**Pro-tip:** Annotate the existing YAML template with inline comments as part of the migration and get it reviewed by your team - it might transpire that a resource is no longer needed and can be removed, meaning there's less to migrate!

As a first step, it is a good idea to read through the template to understand if you have any [stateful resources](stateful-resources.md), as these require a bit of care.

When migrating stateful resources:
1. Identify a resource(s) to move from YAML to CDK.
2. Write the CDK and comment out/delete the resource(s) from the YAML template.
3. Run the tests:
   - If the changes are acceptable, update the snapshot.
   - If the changes are not acceptable, refactor CDK and re-run the tests.
4. With the smallest change made, we can now raise a PR, merge it, and move to the next resource(s).

That is, we can use the snapshot in a [red/green refactor cycle](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html).
We'll repeat this process until the YAML template is empty and can be removed.
