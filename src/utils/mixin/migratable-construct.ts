/**
 * A mixin to add the property `isStatefulConstruct` to a class and execute logic to conditionally override a construct's logicalId when synthesised.
 *
 * Overriding the logicalId makes a migration easier as the resulting CloudFormation template has a smaller difference from that of a running stack.
 *
 * For example, say you have a stack defined in YAML that creates a bucket:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * MyBucket:
 *   Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
 * ```
 *
 * By default, the CDK library will auto-generate the logicalId of resources. That is, by default a bucket would look like:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * MyBucketA0B1C2D:
 *   Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
 * ```
 *
 * Override the logicalId to keep it to `MyBucket`.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * class MyClass extends GuMigratableConstruct(SomeAwsConstruct) { }
 *```
 *
 * Note, if you have `experimentalDecorators` enabled, you can use it as such:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @GuMigratableConstruct
 * class MyClass extends SomeAwsConstruct {
 *
 * }
 * ```
 * As the name suggest, decorators are experimental.
 *
 * @param BaseClass the class to apply the mixin to
 * @constructor
