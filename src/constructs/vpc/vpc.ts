/**
 * Construct which creates a Virtual Private Cloud.
 *
 * NOTE: This construct requires an
 * [environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html)
 * to be set to function correctly. Without this, an environment-agnostic
 * template will be produced, which will only use two AZs even if the region
 * contains more than that. To set this, set the `env` prop when instantiating
 * your stack.
 *
 * NOTE: If using this construct outside eu-west-1, you'll need to commit the
 * `cdk.context.json` file that's created after synthesising locally.
 *
 * Be aware that account IDs are considered sensitive information and should NOT
 * be committed to public repos.
 *
 * The VPC is provisioned with a public and private subnet for each availability
 * zone, with IPs spread evenly across these. Instances in private subnets
 * cannot be accessed directly over the internet. You should locate services in
 * instances in the private subnets, and provide HTTP(S) as required via load
 * balancers living in the public subnets.
 *
 * A CIDR block is a combined IP and network mask that specifies the IP
 * addresses in your VPC. For testing purposes any (AWS supported) CIDR block
 * will do, but for production you should:
 *
 * - use a /21 network mask (providing up to 2048 IPs, which is plenty for most
 *   accounts)
 * - ask Enterprise Tech for an IP address to go with this range (so that
 *   peering with other company VPCs is possible without IP clashes)
 *
 * A managed NAT is created for each private subnet to allow access to the
 * internet.
 *
 * For recommendations on how best to configure your VPC see:
 * https://github.com/guardian/recommendations/blob/main/AWS.md#vpc
 *
 * For more information on VPCs and AWS see:
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html.
