/**
 * A security group to allow a Wazuh agent on an EC2 instance to communicate with the outside.
 * This is implemented as a singleton, meaning only one resource will be created in a stack.
 * If there are multiple apps in the stack, they will re-use this resource.
 *
 * The logicalId will always be "WazuhSecurityGroup".
 *
 * Will create a resource like this:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * WazuhSecurityGroup:
 *   Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
 *   Properties:
 *     GroupDescription: Allow outbound traffic from wazuh agent to manager
 *     VpcId:
 *       Ref: VpcId
 *     SecurityGroupEgress:
 *     - Description: Wazuh event logging
 *       IpProtocol: tcp
 *       FromPort: 1514
 *       ToPort: 1514
 *       CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
 *     - Description: Wazuh agent registration
 *       IpProtocol: tcp
 *       FromPort: 1515
 *       ToPort: 1515
 *       CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
 * ```
 *
 * Which will then get used like this:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * InstanceRoleForAppA:
 *   Type: AWS::IAM::Role
 *   Properties:
 *     SecurityGroups:
 *     - Ref: WazuhSecurityGroup
 *
 * InstanceRoleForAppB:
 *   Type: AWS::IAM::Role
 *   Properties:
 *     SecurityGroups:
 *     - Ref: WazuhSecurityGroup
 * ```
 *
 * Usage within a stack:
 * ```typescript
 * GuWazuhAccess.getInstance(this, vpc);
 * ```
 *
 * @see https://github.com/guardian/security-hq/blob/main/hq/markdown/wazuh.md
